Habitualr

Habits that you want to create and keep, maintain the habit by tracking them daily/weekly and eventualy monthly. A digital tracker / calendar that helps visualize your progress.

Habitualr is a habit building App that lets you pick & track a new or existing habit. I find too often that it only takes a little more accountability to keep those habits in check. I for one strongly beileve that we can take on anything we set our mind to. With Habitualr it has been created to help with keeping that consistency. The biggest obstacle is procrastination and getting motivated to start and further to keep the ball rolling.
