The biggest obstacle is procrastination and being motivated to start. I find too often that it only takes a little more accountability to keep us in check.
I for one strongly beileve that we can take on anything we set our mind to.
With Sproutr it has been created to help with keeping that consistency and gain traction.

Sproutr is a habit building App that lets you choose & track a new or existing habit. At Sproutr
we are about helping those create the habits that matter. The approach we decided to take
when starting this company was to create a friendly and visually appealing app to help those making habits fun.
It's a digital tracker / calendar that helps visualize your progress with motivation along the way.

## Installation

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash

npm install my-project
cd my-project

npm start
# Runs the app in the development mode.
# Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
# You can now see the React App up and running.

npm run build
# Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
# It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
# Your app is ready to be deployed!

npm run start
# which builds and opens a web browser

# other commands:

npm run watch # same as build, but watches for changes
npm run clean # start fresh

```
