This habit is for the workaholics and entrepreneurs out there like myself who forget that “free time” doesn’t mean “freely working on more new projects.” Free time literally means free time.

Go watch an entire movie without getting up halfway through because you feel like you’re being unproductive. This free time as a scheduled habit will help reset your brain and help you return to work later with revitalized enthusiasm."
