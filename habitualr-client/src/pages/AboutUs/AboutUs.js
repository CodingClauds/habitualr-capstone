              1. A habit is a routine of behavior that is repeated regularly and
              tends to occur subconsciously. The American Journal of Psychology
              defined a "habit, from the standpoint of psychology, [as] a more
              or less fixed way of thinking, willing, or feeling acquired
              through previous repetition of a mental experience."
